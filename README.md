# Bank_Fraud_Detection

## Project Overview

### This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudlent bank transactions. Fruad detection is a crucial task is the financial industry, where identifying fraudulent activities early can prevent significant financial losses. The dataset includes transaction details such as time, amount,transaction type,merchant group, and user details(e.g.,country,gender,age,and bank.)

### 1.Data cleaning&Preprocessing
   #### * Remove missing values and coverted "Amount" to numeric format
   #### * Handled categorical features using encoding techniques
   #### * Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
   #### * Exploratory Visualizes Fraud Rates in Different Categories
   #### * Time series analysis
   #### * Variable interaction analysis
### 3.Model Training&Evaluation
   #### * Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost classifiers
   #### * Use Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1 Score,ROC-AUC Score for performance evaluation
